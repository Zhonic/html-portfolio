<h1>The Best Movies According to Hash</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>KGF 2</h3>
<p>
    By far one of the best movies with crazy action <br />
    and also comedy simultaneously.
</p>

<h3>Animal</h3>
<p>
    Really spicy and full of blood and gore, probably not the best movie <br />
    recommended for audiences under 18 years of age. <br />
    R rated movie.
</p>

<h3>Salaar</h3>
<p>
    Really long movie, 3 hours I think. Still has a lot of story and plot. <br />
    Names of characters and a crazy twist at the end (no spoilers). <br />
    A banging movie fo sho!
